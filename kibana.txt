Your messages may be longer than 256 characters, so they are not stored in message.keyword.
In that case, you must either:
Increase the ignore_above value for message.keyword in your index template and reindex your data.
Use an ingest pipeline to extract the DN into a dedicated field at ingest time.

Scripted fields instructions
============================
1. Add a Scripted Field in Kibana
Go to Stack Management → Index Patterns (or Data Views in newer Kibana).
Select your filebeat-* data view.
Click Add field (or "Add scripted field" in older Kibana).
Name it, e.g., extracted_dn.
Set Type to string.
In the script box, enter:
def msg = doc['message.keyword'].value;
def m = /System is using (.+) for authentication purpose/.matcher(msg);
if (m.find()) {
  return m.group(1).trim();
}
return null;
Save the field.

2. Refresh Kibana browser & ensure you have the desired events searched
Visualize in Discover or Lens
Discover:
Add the extracted_dn field as a column to see unique DNs in your logs.
Lens (Data Table):
Go to Visualize → Create visualization → Lens.
Drag extracted_dn to the "Rows" section.
Drag "Count" to "Values".
You’ll see a table of unique DNs and their counts.

Debugging:
- JSON event contains the following:
  "_source": { ...
    "message": "Jun 26 13:11:24 f4b14fe51a56 root: System is using CN=prod-web01,OU=PROD,O=Amazon for authentication purpose.",
    ...
  },
  "fields: {
    "extracted_dn": ["CN=prod..."],
    "message": "June 26...",
    "message.keyword": ["June 26..."]
  }
