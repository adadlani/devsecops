# Pre-setup
# Create python virtual environment (best practice to isolate dependencies)
python3.7 -m venv my-sdk-env
# Enable environment
source my-sdk-env/bin/activate
# Confirm python environment/path
which python # ~/my-sdk-env/bin/python
# Update current pip installation
pip install --upgrade pip

# Download and install SDK
pip install splunk-sdk  # Alterate method easy_install

# Configuration

# Test run
# Launch Python REPL and execute commands:
>>> import splunklib
>>> dir(splunklib)  # display all attributes and methods of an object
>>> print(splunklib.__version__) # display SDK version

# To exercise SDK APIs (authentication, search and alerts, etc)
# Browse to repo devsecops/
